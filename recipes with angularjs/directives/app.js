  Firstly we select the paragraph element, which is a child of the my-widget element using Angularâ€™s children() function  
  as defined by element.  
  In the second step we use jQuery to bind to the click event and modify the css property on click. 
  This is of particular interest since we have a mixture of Angular element functions and jQuery here. In fact under the 
  hood Angular will use jQuery in the children() function if it is defined and will fall back to jqLite  
  (shipped with Angular) otherwise.  

  attributes : For example, you can attach attributes in HTML like: 
  <hello-world some-attribute></hello-world> and access it in the link function as attrs.someAttribute.
